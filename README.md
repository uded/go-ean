go-ean
======

go-ean is a simple utility library for calculating EAN checksum and validating EAN-8, EAN-13 and UPC numbers.
This project is a fork of the project https://github.com/nicholassm/go-ean adopted for the new [Go 1.11 Modules].

## Installation

Import the package in the application code. For example

    import "github.com/victorsmirnov/go-ean/ean"

When you build the project using `go buid` it will install the latest package version automatically
and update `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.

Example output from the `go buid` command:

    $ go build main/*
    go: finding github.com/victorsmirnov/go-ean/ean latest

If you do not use 1.11 Modules you can still install the package using `go get` command

    go get github.com/victorsmirnov/go-ean/ean

## Usage

To calculate a checksum use the `ChecksumEan8`, `ChecksumEan13` or `ChecksumUpc` functions:

    upcStr := "012345678905"
    if c, err := ean.ChecksumUpc(upcStr); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Checksum fail, error %+v\n", err)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("UPC %s, checksum %d\n", upcStr, c)
        // Prints "UPC 012345678905, checksum 5"
    }

To check the validity of a string as EAN-8, EAN-13 or UPC use `Valid`:

    valid = ean.Valid("012345678905")
    fmt.Printf("General validation 629104150021, valid %t\n", valid)
    // Prints "General validation 629104150021, valid true"

See [examples](../blob/master/example/main.go) for complete working application.

## Changes from original library

In the original library `nicholassm/go-ean` the `checksum()` function expected the `ean` string argument
to include the last check digit. In my version the string may not have the last digit.
